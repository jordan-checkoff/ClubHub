## Description
College clubs use a multitude of apps for communicating with their members, including Instagram, Facebook, GroupMe, email, iMessage, and more. This  makes it difficult for students to keep track of the events for all of their clubs, since each club sends different on different platforms. Furthermore, this creates more work for club leaders, who have to adapt their messages to fit each platform and manage their club's presence on each platform. As a result, students often miss important announcements, causing them to miss events that they would have liked to go.

We created ClubHub to solve this problem. ClubHub allows users to follow the clubs that they are a member of and view the list of events for all of those clubs in one place. Upon logging into ClubHub, users see the list of clubs that they follow with links to each club's personalized page, and a list containing the events for all of those clubs. Users can click the search bar to search for a new club, and they can filter their results by club type. After clicking on a club link, users are taken to the club's page, where they can view details about the club and follow/unfollow it.
